# Test Suite Reorganization Summary

## Overview
Successfully reorganized the Sharp test suite from 86+ simple tests to ~64 tests with ~40 comprehensive tests that validate multiple features in realistic scenarios.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Comprehensive Tests
- **core-comprehensive.mlir**: Processor core example with all basic Txn features
- **conflict-matrix-advanced.mlir**: Complex conflict inference and validation
- **control-flow-edge-cases.mlir**: Deep nesting, multiple abort paths, complex guards
- **primitives-all.mlir**: All primitive types with various data types and operations
- **multi-cycle-comprehensive.mlir**: Complete processor pipeline with all launch timing modes
- **reachability-complex.mlir**: Deep method call chains with conditional aborts
- **analysis-integration.mlir**: Multiple analysis passes working together
- **txn-to-firrtl-complete.mlir**: Full TxnToFIRRTL conversion with all features
- **will-fire-all-modes.mlir**: Comparison of static, dynamic, and most-dynamic modes
- **abort-propagation-full.mlir**: Abort propagation through multiple call levels
- **three-phase-execution.mlir**: Value/Execute/Commit phase separation

### 2. Removed Redundant Tests
Removed simple tests that were covered by comprehensive ones:
- basic.mlir (covered by core-comprehensive.mlir)
- primitives.mlir, primitives-memory.mlir, etc. (covered by primitives-all.mlir)
- control-flow.mlir (covered by control-flow-edge-cases.mlir)
- schedule-simple.mlir (covered by comprehensive tests)
- Various simple primitive tests (consolidated into primitives-all.mlir)
- Basic conversion tests (covered by comprehensive conversion tests)

### 3. Maintained Critical Tests
Kept specialized tests that validate specific edge cases:
- guard-condition-debug.mlir
- guard-with-abort.mlir
- launch-conversion-error.mlir
- multi-cycle-firrtl-error.mlir
- Error and negative tests

## Benefits

### 1. Better Coverage
Each comprehensive test validates multiple features together, ensuring they work correctly in combination rather than in isolation.

### 2. More Realistic
Tests use meaningful examples like processor cores, FIFO networks, and state machines rather than trivial syntax checks.

### 3. Easier Maintenance
Fewer files to maintain while providing better coverage. Related features are tested together.

### 4. Better Documentation
Each comprehensive test is well-documented with clear sections explaining what is being tested.

## Test Categories

### Core Dialect (Txn/)
- Reduced from ~24 to ~10 comprehensive tests
- Each test covers multiple operations and edge cases

### Analysis Tests
- Consolidated to ~6 comprehensive tests
- Integration tests that verify passes work together

### Conversion Tests  
- TxnToFIRRTL: ~10 comprehensive tests
- TxnToFunc: ~8 comprehensive tests
- Each covers multiple conversion scenarios

### Simulation Tests
- ~8 comprehensive tests covering all simulation modes
- Three-phase execution, concurrent, JIT, hybrid modes

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring test coverage as new features are added
2. Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows
3. Create performance benchmarks using the comprehensive tests
4. Consider adding stress tests for large designs

## Conclusion

The reorganized test suite provides better validation with fewer files, making it easier to maintain while ensuring comprehensive coverage of all Sharp features. Each test now serves as both validation and documentation of how features should be used together.
