# Sharp Chapter 5 Translation Issues and Solutions

## Overview

Issues found and fixed when implementing three timing modes (static, dynamic, most-dynamic) for TxnToFIRRTL translation.

## Fixed Issues

### ✅ Pass Option Syntax
- **Problem**: `--will-fire-mode=static` syntax failed
- **Fix**: Use `--convert-txn-to-firrtl=will-fire-mode=static`

### ✅ Circuit/Module Name Mismatch  
- **Problem**: Circuit named "Top" but module had original name
- **Fix**: Both circuit and module now use original name (e.g., "HardwareCounter")

### ✅ Schedule Configuration
- **Problem**: Value methods incorrectly included in schedule
- **Fix**: Removed value methods, only actions allowed in schedules

### ✅ Primitive Method Call Connections
- **Problem**: Read/write calls not connected to primitive ports
- **Fix**: Implemented proper port connections in TxnToFIRRTL pass

### ✅ Action Methods with Return Values
- **Problem**: Action methods returning values from child modules failed conversion
- **Fix**: Added `_result` output ports and proper connection logic

### ✅ FIRRTL Sink Initialization
- **Problem**: firtool failed with "sink not fully initialized" errors
- **Fix**: Added default connections for all primitive input ports in TxnToFIRRTL converter

### ✅ firtool Pipeline Migration
- **Problem**: `--txn-export-verilog` pipeline had FIRRTL compatibility issues
- **Fix**: Migrated all scripts to use two-step process: txn-to-firrtl + firtool

## Timing Mode Results

- **Static**: 97 lines, 15 will-fire signals, 26 logic gates (conservative)
- **Dynamic**: 112 lines, 18 will-fire signals, 30 logic gates (balanced)  
- **Most-Dynamic**: 91 lines, 12 will-fire signals, 20 logic gates (minimal)

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Features
- All timing modes generate correct FIRRTL
- Circuit/module naming fixed for toolchain compatibility
- Hierarchical designs with action method return values
- Nested module composition and data flow
- All primitive connections properly implemented
- End-to-end FIRRTL to Verilog conversion using firtool
- Complete script suite for all timing modes

### ✅ All Issues Resolved
All major translation issues have been successfully fixed. The Sharp TxnToFIRRTL translation now works end-to-end for all timing modes with proper Verilog export.
