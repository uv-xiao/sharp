# Sharp Development Diary

## 2025-07-09 - Fixing incorrect launch operations in multi-cycle-comprehensive.mlir

**User Request:** Fix incorrect launch operations with syntax like `%future = txn.launch @functionName(...) timing(...) : (...) -> ...`

**Claude Response:**
- Replaced all incorrect launch operations with proper syntax using `after N { ... txn.yield }` or `until %cond { ... txn.yield }`
- Fixed type mismatches where i32 values were used as conditions for `until` (they need boolean conditions)
- Added txn.future blocks to wrap launch operations in action methods
- Added missing yield statements in txn.if blocks inside rules
- Simplified nested if structures to reduce parsing issues

**Issues Encountered:**
- Launch operations have specific syntax requirements with body regions
- The `until` variant requires boolean conditions, not integer values
- txn.if blocks inside rules require proper terminators
- Deeply nested if structures cause block terminator issues in MLIR parsing
- Launch operations should generally be in txn.future blocks inside action methods

**Status:** Test file has remaining parsing issues with nested if structures. Proper solution would be to refactor multi-cycle operations into separate action methods rather than embedding them directly in rules.

## 2025-07-08 - Documentation-Implementation Alignment

**User Request:** "Fix TxnToFIRRTL Will-Fire Logic and Implement Three-Phase Execution Model to align implementation with documentation"

**Claude Response:**
- Implemented comprehensive reach_abort calculation in TxnToFIRRTL conversion
- Updated ReachabilityAnalysis to treat abort operations similarly to method calls

- Fixed node duplication issue in will-fire signal generation

## 2025-07-08 - Abort Propagation & Primitive Method Signatures

**User Request:** "Fix full abort propagation; fix MemRef conflicts; update tests. Primitive methods shouldn't return i1 - transformation pass should add it."

**Claude Response:**

**User Request:** "Rethink all tests (documented in `docs/test.md`, code in `test/`). We don't need so much easy ones. Make them fewer and concise, but more challenging and comprehensive to fully validate the documented features."

**Claude Response:**

## 2025-07-09 - Comprehensive Test Suite Fixes

## 2025-07-09 - Architectural Fixes and Deep Improvements

**User Request:** "You should make true progress by major rewrites of the complex tests (must use the correct syntax), and fixing architectural issues in the implementation (for dominance errors, etcs.)"

**Claude Response:**
- Rewrote multi-cycle-comprehensive.mlir with correct launch syntax:
  - Changed invalid `txn.launch @functionName(...)` to proper `txn.launch after N { ... txn.yield }`
  - Added txn.future blocks to wrap launch operations in action methods
  - Fixed all launch syntax throughout the test
- Rewrote reachability-complex.mlir to fix control flow:
  - Changed action methods to not return values (use txn.yield instead of txn.return)
  - Fixed nested if-else structures
- Fixed architectural issue with most-dynamic mode dominance error:
  - Removed two-pass will-fire generation that violated SSA form
  - Created will-fire signals in single pass to maintain dominance
  - Fixed lines 1973-1988 in TxnToFIRRTLPass.cpp
- Improved operation conversion in convertBodyOps:
  - Added two-pass approach: first convert all operations, then handle control flow
  - Added proper condition conversion for txn.if statements
  - Ensured all operations are converted before being used
- Fixed txn.if terminator issues:
  - Added txn.yield to all if/else branches in action methods
  - Changed txn.return to txn.yield in action methods

## 2025-07-09 - Primitive Crashes and Error Handling (Session Continue)

**User Request:** "Move on the remaining issues. Implement launch, and do more fixes."

**Claude Response:**
- **Fixed Primitive FIRRTL Creation Crashes**: Added Memory primitive support to TxnToFIRRTL conversion, preventing crashes when Memory/FIFO primitives can't be created
- **Improved Error Handling**: Fixed crash where failed primitive creation would cause assertion failures later in conversion pipeline by adding proper failure flag propagation in instance walk lambda
- **Added Proper Failure Propagation**: Updated instance conversion logic to properly detect and propagate primitive creation failures back to main conversion function via `instanceConversionFailed` flag
- **Validated Core Primitives**: Confirmed Register and Wire primitives work correctly - can generate proper FIRRTL modules with clock/reset connections
- **Maintained Test Status**: Still at 51/71 tests passing (71.83%) but eliminated crashes and improved error reporting
- **Implementation Details**: 
  - Added `createMemoryFIRRTLModule` function declaration and placeholder implementation
  - Updated `getOrCreatePrimitiveFIRRTLModule` to support Memory primitives  
  - Fixed instance conversion walk to properly return failure when primitive creation fails
- **Next Steps**: Need to implement actual FIRRTL modules for Memory/FIFO primitives (currently return nullptr) and complete launch operation support
