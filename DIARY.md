# Sharp Development Diary

## 2025-07-08 - Documentation-Implementation Alignment

**User Request:** "Fix TxnToFIRRTL Will-Fire Logic and Implement Three-Phase Execution Model to align implementation with documentation"

**Claude Response:**
- Implemented comprehensive reach_abort calculation in TxnToFIRRTL conversion
- Updated ReachabilityAnalysis to treat abort operations similarly to method calls
- Fixed will-fire generation to include reach_abort in static, dynamic, and most-dynamic modes
- Implemented Three-Phase Execution Model in Simulator.cpp:
  - Added executeValuePhase() for once-per-cycle value method calculation
  - Split execution into executeEventPhase() (no commit) and executeCommitPhase()
  - Added value method cache infrastructure
- Test results: 81/93 passing (87.10%)
- Fixed node duplication issue in will-fire signal generation

## 2025-07-08 - Abort Propagation & Primitive Method Signatures

**User Request:** "Fix full abort propagation; fix MemRef conflicts; update tests. Primitive methods shouldn't return i1 - transformation pass should add it."

**Claude Response:** 
- Implemented complete abort propagation using post-processing approach
- Fixed MemRef dialect registration by adding to dependent dialects  
- Modified primitive method signatures - i1 return type now added by transformation
- Fixed 3 failing tests; 4 tests remain with minor issues
- Test results: 98/102 passing (96.08%)

## 2025-07-07 - TxnToFunc Implementation

**User Request:** "Implement TxnToFunc conversion with will-fire logic and scheduler generation"

**Claude Response:**
- Created complete TxnToFunc pass with transactional execution model
- Implemented scheduler generation with conflict checking
- Added abort propagation infrastructure
- Fixed control flow conversion (txn.if → scf.if)
- Test results improved to 91.18% passing

## 2025-07-06 - Execution Model & Launch Operations

**User Request:** "Update execution model: schedules contain only rules, not value methods"

**Claude Response:**
- Updated all tests to follow correct execution model
- Implemented FutureOp and LaunchOp for multi-cycle execution
- Added validation passes for schedule correctness
- Fixed simulation code generation for three-phase execution
- All execution model tests passing

## 2025-07-05 - Test Suite Reorganization

**User Request:** "Fix failing tests and improve test infrastructure"

**Claude Response:**
- Fixed Python binding build issues
- Consolidated redundant tests (59 → 51)
- Added 13 new tests for untested features
- Created comprehensive test documentation
- Test results: 57/61 passing (93.44%)

## 2025-07-04 - Simulation Infrastructure

**User Request:** "Implement multiple simulation modes: TL, RTL, JIT, concurrent, hybrid"

**Claude Response:**
- Implemented 5 simulation modes with proper infrastructure
- Created DAM-based concurrent simulation
- Added JIT compilation via LLVM
- Integrated RTL simulation via arcilator
- Created hybrid TL/RTL bridge
- All simulation tests passing

## 2025-07-03 - Python Frontend

**User Request:** "Create PySharp frontend following PyCDE pattern"

**Claude Response:**
- Implemented complete Python frontend at frontends/PySharp/
- Created type system, signal abstractions, module builders
- Fixed runtime loading issues with proper package structure
- Added comprehensive test examples
- Frontend functional with pixi Python 3.13

## 2025-07-02 - Verilog Export

**User Request:** "Add Verilog export capability"

**Claude Response:**
- Integrated with CIRCT's export infrastructure
- Created custom pipelines: --txn-export-verilog
- Full pipeline: Txn → FIRRTL → HW → Verilog
- Added comprehensive documentation and tests
- Export working for both single/split file modes

## 2025-07-01 - Parametric Primitives

**User Request:** "Implement automatic primitive construction with parametric typing"

**Claude Response:**
- Added on-demand primitive creation
- Implemented parametric typing: @instance of @Module<type>
- Generates unique FIRRTL modules per type instantiation
- Complete test coverage added
- All primitive tests passing

## 2025-06-30 - TxnToFIRRTL Conversion

**User Request:** "Implement complete Txn to FIRRTL conversion"

**Claude Response:**
- Created full conversion pass with will-fire logic
- Added conflict matrix checking
- Implemented ready signals for action methods
- Added type conversion for integers and vectors
- 45/45 tests passing

## 2025-06-29 - Initial Implementation

**User Request:** "Create Sharp transaction dialect based on PLAN.md"

**Claude Response:**
- Set up MLIR infrastructure with CIRCT integration
- Created Txn dialect with modules, methods, rules
- Added conflict matrix support (SB=0, SA=1, C=2, CF=3)
- Implemented basic primitives (Register, Wire)
- Initial test suite established
