# Sharp Development Status

This document tracks the implementation progress of features outlined in PLAN.md.

## Overview

Sharp is a transaction-based hardware description language with conflict matrix support and FIRRTL/Verilog generation capabilities. The project implements custom MLIR dialects for hardware description using transaction-level modeling inspired by Bluespec and Koika.

### ðŸ“‹ Planned

- **Simulation at Arbitrary Level**
  - Transactional: event-driven, both spec/hw modules/primitives
    - spec actions can be multi-cycle: they have a sequence of behavior (trigger other actions) to be finished in a specific sequence of time steps.
    - learn from EQueue (references/Li-2022-EQueue.pdf) and DAM (references/Zhang-2024-DAM.pdf, https://github.com/stanford-ppl/DAM-RS)
    - try to be high-performance (concurrent simulation)
  - RTL: use CIRCT's `arcilator`
  - Testbench: we can specify several instances to server as both a testbench generator and a result checker, and others to be tested against them.
  - Hybrid: can we specify several instances to be simulated at transaction-level, and others at RTL-level? They should be able to communicate with each other.

- **Additional Primitives**
  - FIFO, Memory, and other common hardware primitives
  - Spec primitives for formal verification  
  
- **Performance Optimizations**
  - Optimize will-fire logic generation
  - Reduce redundant conflict checks
  - Implement dead code elimination

### ðŸš« Known Limitations
- Python bindings have runtime issues
- Multi-cycle operations not yet supported in translation
- Nonsynthesizable primitives will fail translation

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Additional Primitives**
   - Create FIFO primitive with enqueue/dequeue methods
   - Add Memory primitive with read/write ports
   - Design spec primitives for verification
   
2. **Enhanced Analysis**
   - Implement combinational loop detection
   - Add performance analysis passes
   - Create resource utilization estimates
   
3. **Fix Empty When Block Issue**
   - Update TxnToFIRRTL conversion to avoid empty when regions
   - Ensure all action bodies generate valid FIRRTL
   
4. **Tooling and Integration**
   - Fix Python bindings for programmatic access
   - Create VSCode/IDE language support
   - Add debugging and visualization tools
