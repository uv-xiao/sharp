### ðŸš§ In Progress

- **Enhanced Txn-to-FIRRTL Features**

  - [x] Implement submodule instantiation and port connections (already working)
  - [x] Handle CallOp translation to connect to submodule methods (already working)
  - [ ] Support proper register/wire state management in primitives
  - [x] Add support for more complex data types (vectors, wider integers)
  - [ ] Implement primitive method calls (Register.read, Wire.write, etc.)
  - [x] Full conflict_inside with conditional reachability (2025-07-01)
    - Implemented dynamic conflict detection using condition operands
    - Added conversion for arith operations to FIRRTL
    - Some edge cases with block arguments still need refinement

### ðŸ“‹ Planned

- **FIRRTL Translation**
  - Reference: Bourgeat-2020-Koika.pdf, implementation at https://github.com/mit-plv/koika/blob/master/coq/CircuitGeneration.v
  - Synthesizable primitives:
    - Place in `lib/Dialect/Txn/primitives/`
    - Initial primitives needed: Register, Wire
  - Implement txn-to-FIRRTL conversion pass extending Koika translation
  - Extended will-fire (wf) logic:
    - Consider general conflicts from conflict matrix (not just register R/W)
    - Prevent firing when previous action conflicts per CM
    - Return false if rule calls same action method multiple times
  - Bottom-up translation order (submodules first)

- **Txn-level combinational loop detection**
  - current implementation is not correct, since we don't have attributes in `txn.primitive` to define combinational paths.
  
- **Verilog Export**
  - Add sharp-opt command-line options for triggering translation
  - Support different export-verilog options from CIRCT
  - Integration with CIRCT's export-verilog infrastructure

### ðŸš« Known Limitations
- Python bindings have runtime issues
- Multi-cycle operations not yet supported in translation
- Nonsynthesizable primitives will fail translation

## Implementation Notes

### Conflict Matrix Inference Rules
1. Any action conflicts (C) with itself
2. Actions that are both SA and SB conflict (C)
3. Actions calling same action method of same instance conflict (C)
4. Conflict propagation through method calls:
   - m0 SA m1 => a0 SA a1
   - m0 SB m1 => a0 SB a1
   - m0 C m1 => a0 C a1
5. Default to conflict-free (CF) if relationship cannot be determined

### Translation Architecture
- Bottom-up translation: submodules before parent modules
- Will-fire logic must consider:
  - Conflict matrix relationships
  - Register read/write conflicts
  - Multiple calls to same action method (always conflicts)
