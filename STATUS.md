# Sharp Development Status

This document tracks the implementation progress of features outlined in PLAN.md.

## Overview

Sharp is a transaction-based hardware description language with conflict matrix support and FIRRTL/Verilog generation capabilities. The project implements custom MLIR dialects for hardware description using transaction-level modeling inspired by Bluespec and Koika.
