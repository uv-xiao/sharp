### 🚧 In Progress

- **Clarifying Execution Semantics and Model across the Whole Project**
  - terminology: "action" = "rule" + "action method".
  - schedule only specifies the order of actions, any "value method" is not included.
    - the schedule pass should check this.
  - "value method" must be conflict-free with other actions. Therefore, "Wire"'s "read" cannot be a "value method", since "read SA write" is required.
    - analysis pass should check this.
  - action cannot call other actions in the same module; action can call value methods in the same module.
    - analysis pass should check this.
  - The "Execution Semantics" `docs/execution_model.md` is not correct. The correct one is:
  ```
  Single Cycle Execution:
    // there is no scheduling phase, since the schedule is already specified in the MLIR file.
    1. Value phase:
      calculate the value of all "value methods", the values remain unchanged until the next cycle.
    2. Execution phase:
      for each scheduled action in order:
        if the action is an "action method":
          stalls until this action method is enabled by an action from the parent module or all actions calling this action method have aborted in the current cycle;
          check guard and conflict matrix;
          execute the action method and record aborting or success(return value);
        if the action is a "rule":
          check guard and conflict matrix;
          execute the rule and record aborting or success;
    3. Commit phase:
      apply all state updates due to recorded execution success;
      advance to next cycle;
  Multi-Cycle Execution:
    // The "Timing Attributes" is not correct and should be removed.
    // The "Launch Operations" is robust and must be supported. I've specified it in `docs/execution_model.md`.
    // Similar to the single cycle execution, but one action can trigger multiple launches.
    1. Value phase: the same as single cycle execution.
    2. Execution phase:
      for each scheduled action in order:
        if the action is single-cycle:
          the same as single cycle execution;
        if the action is multi-cycle:
          // history updates
          for every execution that started in the past but not finished:
            update inner execution status;
            check if a new launch can be triggered in the current cycle;
              if yes: trigger the launch;
            record panic if a required action fails in the current cycle (conflict or guard violation) -- only static launch can cause panic.
            record the execution success in the current cycle;
          
          // new execution starts
          if the action is a "action method":
            stalls until this action method is enabled by an action from the parent module or all actions calling this action method have aborted in the current cycle;
            check guard and conflict matrix;
            try execute the "per-cycle actions" in the current cycle;
            start a new execution if no aborting;
          if the action is a "rule":
            check guard and conflict matrix;
            try execute the "per-cycle actions" in the current cycle;
            start a new execution if no aborting;
    3. Commit phase:
      apply all state updates due to recorded execution success;
      advance to next cycle;
  ```
  - All the involved code (txn-to-firrtl, simulation, bindings, frontends, examples, etc.) should be fixed. Operations should be removed or implemented.
  - All the involved tests should be fixed or more comprehensive should be added. They must be passed after the above fixes.
  - All the involved documents and examples should be fixed.
