# SHARP = Stacking Hardware, Architecture, and Programming

## Description

This framework aims to bridge description, optimization, and implementation of hardware, architecture, and software.

The short-term plan is to develop individual IRs for architecture and hardware. They are implemented as MLIR dialects and interact with CIRCT for RTL generation and other tasks.

> [!NOTE]
> Ultimate Goal: Unified IR for multi-purpose architecture design, synthesized for hardware and programming model generation. 

## Setup 

See [setup.md](./setup.md) for details.
