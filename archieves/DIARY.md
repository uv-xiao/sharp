# Sharp Development Diary

## 2025-06-29 - Initial Directory and Extension Addition

### User Request
Add `.sharp` directory support to the codebase similar to CIRCT's `.circt` directory.

### Work Done
- Added `.sharp` to `.gitignore`
- Updated build configuration to include `sharp` as a library component
- Created initial directory structure

### Rationale
Following CIRCT's pattern of having a hidden directory for local development artifacts that shouldn't be version controlled.

## 2025-06-30 - PySharp Directory Creation

### User Request
Create PySharp directory structure for Python bindings following CIRCT's patterns.

### Directory Structure Created
```
pysharp/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── pyproject.toml
├── src/
│   └── PySharp/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── dialects/
│           └── __init__.py
├── test/
│   └── test_basic.py
└── tools/
    └── pysharp-tool.py
```

### Key Changes
- Modified top-level CMakeLists.txt to add PySharp subdirectory
- Configured Python bindings to follow CIRCT's structure
- Created basic test infrastructure

## 2025-07-01 - Basic Documentation Setup

### Morning: Documentation Infrastructure

**User Request**: Help set up the basic documentation structure

**Work Completed**:
- Created `docs/` directory with initial markdown files
- Added basic README files for major components
- Set up documentation build infrastructure

### Afternoon: TXN Dialect Foundations

**User Request**: Begin implementing TXN (Transaction) dialect

**Key Concepts Introduced**:
- Transaction-based hardware modeling
- Atomic transaction semantics
- Method-based interfaces (action methods, value methods)

**Files Created**:
- `include/sharp/Dialect/Txn/TxnDialect.td`
- `include/sharp/Dialect/Txn/TxnOps.td`
- Basic operation definitions

## 2025-07-02 - TXN Implementation Progress

### Morning: Core TXN Operations

**Work Completed**:
- Implemented `txn.module` operation
- Added `txn.action_method` and `txn.value_method` operations
- Created basic verification logic

**Technical Decisions**:
- Methods use function-like syntax with explicit return types
- Action methods modify state, value methods are read-only
- Modules contain methods and maintain internal state

### Evening: Build System Fixes

**Issues Resolved**:
- Fixed CMake configuration for proper dialect registration
- Resolved linking issues with MLIR/LLVM libraries
- Got basic txn operations parsing correctly

## 2025-07-03 - Conflict Matrix and Scheduling

### Morning Session (ID: session-20250703-001)

**User Request**: Add conflict matrix and scheduling support to TXN dialect

**Major Feature Added**: Conflict Matrix
- Added `txn.schedule` operation with conflict matrix attribute
- Matrix represents pairwise conflicts between methods:
  - 0 (SB): Sequence Before
  - 1 (SA): Sequence After  
  - 2 (C): Conflict
  - 3 (CF): Conflict Free

**Files Modified**:
- Updated TxnOps.td with schedule operation
- Added dictionary attribute for conflict matrix
- Implemented verification logic

### Afternoon: Analysis Infrastructure

**Work Completed**:
- Created analysis pass framework
- Added infer-conflict-matrix pass
- Started implementation of automatic conflict detection

## 2025-07-04 - Python Bindings Challenges

### Session: Python Integration Struggles

**Problem Encountered**: 
Python bindings were failing to import with undefined symbol errors

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. MLIR Python bindings use a complex initialization system
2. The `_mlir` module contains C++ implemented submodules
3. Package prefixes in CMake must match runtime structure
4. Sharp was trying to create independent bindings instead of extending CIRCT's

**Solution Implemented**:
- Changed approach to extend CIRCT bindings (like PyCDE does)
- Used proper package prefix configuration
- Simplified binding structure to reuse CIRCT infrastructure

**Key Learning**: 
Don't fight the MLIR Python binding system - work with it by extending existing bindings rather than creating parallel structures.

### Files Modified
- `lib/Bindings/Python/CMakeLists.txt` - Fixed package structure
- `lib/Bindings/Python/TxnModule.cpp` - Simplified to extend CIRCT bindings
- Created operations programmatically instead of importing

### Technical Details Documented
- How MLIR dialects expose Python bindings
- Why _mlir submodules cause import issues  
- How PyCDE successfully extends CIRCT bindings
- Package prefix mechanism and configuration

### Validation/Testing Issues
During testing of Python bindings:
- Initial approach of standalone PySharp package failed
- Discovered operations should be created programmatically
- Operations should be created using MLIR Python API instead

### Documentation Created
Created comprehensive `docs/python_binding.md` explaining:
- MLIR/CIRCT Python binding architecture
- Package prefix mechanism and why it matters
- How PyCDE avoids _mlir import issues
- Recommended solutions for binding structure

### Results
- Python bindings now work correctly with pixi Python 3.13
- PySharp can import and use Sharp functionality
- Build completes without errors
- Import structure follows established patterns

### Technical Insights
1. MLIR Python bindings are sensitive to package structure
2. The _mlir module uses C++ submodules that require proper initialization
3. Package prefixes must match between CMake configuration and runtime
4. PyCDE succeeds by reusing CIRCT bindings, not creating its own
5. Dialect operations in MLIR Python are typically created programmatically, not imported as modules

## 2025-07-05 - Documentation Update and Fixes

### User Request
The user identified several issues in the documentation:
1. `txn.read`/`txn.write` operations were used incorrectly - these are not implemented
2. `simulation.md` lacked methodology insights
3. Parametric primitive syntax in `txn_primitive.md` was wrong
4. `txn.launch` disappeared from `execution_model.md`

### Work Done

#### 1. Fixed txn.read/txn.write Usage
- Replaced all instances with proper `txn.call` to primitive methods across all docs
- Correct syntax: `%val = txn.call @instance.method() : () -> Type`
- Updated examples in simulation.md, txn.md, execution_model.md, and txn_primitive.md

#### 2. Enhanced simulation.md
Added comprehensive methodology sections:
- **Key Design Principles**: Event-driven architecture, 1RaaT semantics, multi-level abstraction
- **Technical details**: Event struct, DAM methodology explanation
- **Simulation Methodology**: Guidance on choosing simulation levels
- **Performance optimization strategies**: Event queue, concurrent tuning, memory management
- **Verification methodology**: Reference models, assertions, coverage

#### 3. Fixed Parametric Primitive Grammar
- Corrected syntax: `%inst = txn.instance @name of @Primitive<Type> : !txn.module<"Primitive">`
- Fixed all examples to use actual test file patterns
- Added realistic control flow and conflict matrices

#### 4. Restored txn.launch Documentation
- Added section showing both approaches:
  - Current: timing attributes (`attributes {timing = "static(3)"}`)
  - Future: `txn.launch {latency=3} { ... }` blocks
- Clarified implementation status

### Documentation Quality Improvements
- All MLIR examples now match actual test file syntax
- Added technical insights and rationale for design decisions
- Enhanced examples with more realistic use cases
- Clear distinction between implemented and planned features

### Key Learnings
- Documentation must stay synchronized with implementation
- Test files are the best source of truth for syntax
- Users value both practical examples and theoretical insights

## 2025-07-06 - Simulation Workspace Generation & Tutorial Creation

### Morning: Implementing Workspace Generation Feature
**Session ID**: Current session (continuing from 2025-07-05)

**User Request**: "Move forward STATUS.md" - Implement the **Simulation Workspace** feature specified in STATUS.md:
- Instead of generating only C++ code, generate complete workspaces containing:
  - C++ code
  - Build script (CMake) 
  - README (how to build and run the product)
- The generated workspace should not rely on LLVM, CIRCT, or MLIR (standalone)

**Implementation Progress**:
1. **Created SimulationWorkspaceGenerator class** in TxnSimulatePass.cpp:
   - Generates Counter_sim.cpp with simulation code
   - Creates CMakeLists.txt for building the simulation
   - Generates README.md with build/run instructions
   - Creates SimulationBase.h/cpp with base simulation infrastructure

2. **Fixed Compilation Issues**:
   - Resolved forward declaration problems by reordering CppCodeGenerator and SimulationWorkspaceGenerator classes
   - Fixed InstanceOp method names (getModule() → getModuleName(), getInstanceName() → getSymName())
   
3. **Fixed Code Generation Bug**:
   - Issue: Generated code was using `count.read_data` instead of `count_data`
   - Root cause: The call operation handler was checking for `.read` in leaf reference, but with `::` syntax it's just `read`
   - Solution: Updated both `generateSimpleActionMethod` and `generateSimpleValueMethod` to check for both `.read`/`.write` and plain `read`/`write`
   - Result: Code now correctly generates `count_data` for primitive state access

4. **Successful Workspace Generation**:
   - Created test script `test-workspace-gen.sh` to extract C++ code from simulation pass output
   - Generated complete counter workspace with all required files
   - Successfully built and ran the simulation executable
   - Simulation runs with configurable cycles, verbose output, and statistics

5. **Created Workspace Generation Tool**:
   - Developed `tools/generate-workspace.sh` script
   - Properly handles MLIR pass option syntax (`--sharp-simulate="mode=translation"`)
   - Extracts C++ code from pass output (before MLIR module dump)
   - Generates all required files for standalone simulation
