- Core concepts:
  - **Modules**: Hardware components with state
  - **Methods**: Value methods (combinational) and Action methods (state-changing)
  - **Rules**: Guarded atomic actions
  - **Instances**: Module instantiation and composition

### Implementation Details
- Created TxnDialect with proper registration
- Implemented core operations: ModuleOp, MethodOp, RuleOp, InstanceOp
- Added method call operations for inter-module communication
- Created comprehensive test suite

**User's Example Format**:
```mlir
%s = txn.schedule @Module conflicts {
  "r1" = ["r2" = C, "r3" = SA],
  "r2" = ["r3" = CF]
} {...}
```

```mlir
%s = txn.schedule @Module conflicts {
  "r1" = ["r2" = C, "r3" = SA],
  "r2" = ["r3" = CF]
} {...}
```

### Testing Requirements
- "Create comprehensive test coverage"
- "Tests must pass before committing"
- "Add tests for all new features"

These specific examples demonstrate how user requests drive the development process, with clear specifications, architectural decisions, and quality requirements guiding each implementation phase.

#### Initial Request
- **Goal**: Move forward with Pythonic Construction Frontend in STATUS.md
- **Requirements**:
  1. Guarantee Sharp's Python bindings can access MLIR and CIRCT dialects
  2. Create a frontend module (PySharp) for EDSL functionality
  3. Provide access to mlir/circt/sharp dialects

#### Iteration 1: Initial Implementation Attempt
- Claude started by analyzing existing Python bindings
- Searched for MLIR/CIRCT import patterns in test files
- User provided additional guidance:
  - Read specific CIRCT binding files to understand dialect exposure
  - Remove the Sharp Core dialect (not useful)
  - Implement Sharp Python bindings to expose: MLIR(SCF/SMT/index), CIRCT(firrtl/Comb/Hw/HWArith/), Sharp(txn)

#### Iteration 2: Course Correction - Remove HW Dialect
- User found duplicate dialect registration issue with "builtin"
- Requested removal of circt/hw from Sharp's Python binding to avoid conflicts
- Continue with remaining tasks

#### Iteration 3: Major Design Change - Follow PyCDE Pattern
- User disagreed with initial EDSL implementation approach
- **Key Feedback**: "I don't agree the edsl implementation in lib/Bindings/Python/pysharp.py which imports mlir/circt/sharp dialects"
- **New Direction**: Learn from /home/uvxiao/sharp/circt/frontends/PyCDE structure
- Specifically: PyCDE's __init__.py only imports from .circt, not directly from MLIR/CIRCT
- Add tests similar to PyCDE's integration_test

#### Iteration 4: Final Tasks
- Remove unnecessary pixi commands (test-python, test-construction)
- Update docs/pythonic_frontend.md
- Git add, commit, and push changes

#### Iteration 5: New Task - Simulation Framework
- Move to "Simulation at Arbitrary Level" in STATUS.md
- Read references (Li-2022-EQueue.pdf)
- Create docs/simulation.md with design details
- Implement code, add tests

### Session: 2025-07-03 (263fca29-693d-4e09-b25e-fa792ea77b5a)

#### Initial Problem
- User tried running: `pixi run python3 ./test/python/construction_test.py`
- Error: "No module named 'sharp.construction'"
- Requirements:
  1. Fix Python bindings and PYTHONPATH setup
  2. Rename sharp.construction → sharp.edsl
  3. Support general mlir/firrtl types and operations
  4. Support txn operations (schedule, if, ...)

#### Iteration 1: Nanobind Runtime Issue
- Initial fix attempts failed due to nanobind runtime issue
- User requested: "pixi run test-construction still fails due to nanobind runtime issue. Resolve the issue!"

#### Iteration 2: Architecture Redesign
- User provided architectural guidance:
  - CIRCT implements lib/Bindings/Python, then frontends/PyCDE as EDSL
  - Sharp should follow same pattern
  - In lib/Bindings/Python: only import mlir, build with dialects from mlir/circt/sharp
  - Avoid importing both mlir and circt to prevent duplicate registration

#### Final Requirements
- Fix linking errors
- Guarantee Sharp's Python binding can access MLIR and CIRCT dialects
- Create PySharp frontend module for EDSL functionality

### Common Iteration Patterns

1. **Progressive Refinement**: Users often start with high-level goals and provide more specific implementation details as work progresses

2. **Course Corrections**: When implementation doesn't match user's mental model, they provide explicit counterexamples (e.g., "look at PyCDE")

3. **Reference-Based Learning**: Users frequently point to existing implementations as patterns to follow

4. **Problem-Solution Cycles**: Users report specific errors (e.g., nanobind issues) and expect iterative debugging

5. **Architecture Evolution**: Initial implementations often need fundamental restructuring based on user feedback

6. **Documentation Requirements**: Users expect documentation updates alongside implementation

7. **Testing Emphasis**: Every implementation should include comprehensive tests

8. **Commit Discipline**: Users want atomic, well-documented commits for each feature
