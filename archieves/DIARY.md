# Sharp Development Diary

## 2025-07-06 (Session 2) - Multi-cycle Execution Implementation

### User Request
Continue with: "Move on: - Consider removing timing attributes... - Implement launch operations..."

### Work Completed

**Morning/Afternoon: Multi-cycle Execution**
1. **Removed Timing Attributes**:
   - Confirmed timing attributes (combinational/static/dynamic) were not used
   - Removed from ValueMethodOp, ActionMethodOp, and RuleOp in TxnOps.td
   - Cleaned up all test files removing timing attribute references
   - PreSynthesisCheck.cpp already handled gracefully

2. **Implemented Launch Operations**:
   - Added FutureOp: Region container for multi-cycle actions
   - Added LaunchOp: Deferred execution with dependencies and latency
   - Final syntax: `txn.launch until %cond after N { ... }`
   - Implemented LaunchOp::verify() for validation
   - Updated execution_model.md with launch semantics

3. **Technical Challenges**:
   - Assembly format conflicts between `{latency=N}` and region syntax
   - Tried multiple approaches: `@N`, `(latency = N)`, settled on `after N`
   - Complex header file include issues with generated code
   - TableGen assembly format limitations

4. **Build Issues Encountered**:
   - TableGen-generated code has namespace resolution problems
   - Generated methods like `getODSOperands()` calling `getOperation()` incorrectly
   - `getBody()` method generating `(*this)->getRegion(0)` with incorrect syntax
   - Namespace issue: types being resolved as `sharp::txn::mlir::` instead of `::mlir::`
   - Fixed extraClassDeclaration to provide required interface methods
   - Changed AnyRegion to SizedRegion<1> for proper generation

**Files Modified**:
- include/sharp/Dialect/Txn/TxnOps.td
- lib/Dialect/Txn/TxnOps.cpp
- docs/execution_model.md
- test/Dialect/Txn/multi-cycle.mlir
- test/Dialect/Txn/launch-simple.mlir
- include/sharp/Dialect/Txn/TxnOps.h
- Various test files (timing removal)

**Status**: Launch operations defined but build is blocked by TableGen namespace issues. Need to resolve build errors before proceeding with conversion/simulation support.

## 2025-07-06 - Execution Model Refinement

### User Request
Continuing from STATUS.md's in-progress task: "Clarifying Execution Semantics and Model across the Whole Project"

### Work Completed

**Morning/Afternoon: Execution Model Clarification**
1. **Updated `docs/execution_model.md`**:
   - Clarified three-phase execution: Value Phase → Execution Phase → Commit Phase
   - Removed scheduling phase (schedules are fixed in MLIR, not dynamic)
   - Clarified terminology: "action" = "rule" + "action method"
   - Documented that value methods are NOT schedulable

2. **Created Three New Analysis Passes**:
   - `ScheduleValidation`: Ensures schedules only contain actions, not value methods
   - `ValueMethodConflictCheck`: Verifies value methods are conflict-free (CF) with all actions
   - `ActionCallValidation`: Prevents actions from calling other actions in same module

3. **Updated TxnToFIRRTL Conversion**:
   - Now rejects value methods in schedules with error (not skip)
   - Validates action-to-action calls are prohibited
   - Added comprehensive error messages

4. **Updated Simulation Code Generation**:
   - Implemented three-phase execution model in TxnSimulatePass
   - Added value method caching (computed once per cycle)
   - Proper scheduling based on fixed schedule operation

5. **Fixed Python Bindings**:
   - Removed deprecated SB (SequenceBefore) and SA (SequenceAfter) relations
   - Updated ConflictRelation enum to only have C and CF
   - Updated PySharp common.py to match

6. **Updated All Tests**:
   - Fixed ~20 test files to remove value methods from schedules
   - Updated conflict matrices to use only C/CF relations
   - Fixed primitive method calls to use :: syntax
   - Created new test files for validation passes

7. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Fixed txn.md to remove SB/SA documentation
   - Updated txn_to_firrtl.md to reflect fixed scheduling
   - Updated examples to match new execution model

### Technical Insights
- The move from dynamic scheduling to fixed scheduling simplifies the execution model
- Value methods being non-schedulable ensures they're truly side-effect free
- The three-phase model matches standard synchronous hardware semantics
- Removing SB/SA relations reduces complexity while maintaining expressiveness

### Next Steps
- Consider removing timing attributes (combinational/static/dynamic) as they're no longer used
- Implement launch operations for multi-cycle execution as specified in execution_model.md

### Key Clarifications from User
- SA/SB relations are ESSENTIAL and must be kept for:
  - Partial schedule constraints (when schedule is not fully determined)
  - Propagating constraints from instance actions to parent module
  - ActionScheduling pass to complete partial schedules
  - Computing conflict function for instance method calls
- Value methods must be always ready:
  - Cannot be in schedules (only actions are schedulable)
  - Must have CF (Conflict-Free) relations with ALL other methods
  - Cannot have SA/SB/C relations as they could lead to conflicts

## 2025-06-29 - Initial Directory and Extension Addition

### User Request
Add `.sharp` directory support to the codebase similar to CIRCT's `.circt` directory.

### Work Done
- Added `.sharp` to `.gitignore`
- Updated build configuration to include `sharp` as a library component
- Created initial directory structure

### Rationale
Following CIRCT's pattern of having a hidden directory for local development artifacts that shouldn't be version controlled.

## 2025-06-30 - PySharp Directory Creation

### User Request
Create PySharp directory structure for Python bindings following CIRCT's patterns.

### Directory Structure Created
```
pysharp/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── pyproject.toml
├── src/
│   └── PySharp/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── dialects/
│           └── __init__.py
├── test/
│   └── test_basic.py
└── tools/
    └── pysharp-tool.py
```

### Key Changes
- Modified top-level CMakeLists.txt to add PySharp subdirectory
- Configured Python bindings to follow CIRCT's structure
- Created basic test infrastructure

## 2025-07-01 - Basic Documentation Setup

### Morning: Documentation Infrastructure

**User Request**: Help set up the basic documentation structure

**Work Completed**:
- Created `docs/` directory with initial markdown files
- Added basic README files for major components
- Set up documentation build infrastructure

### Afternoon: TXN Dialect Foundations

**User Request**: Begin implementing TXN (Transaction) dialect

**Key Concepts Introduced**:
- Transaction-based hardware modeling

- Method-based interfaces (action methods, value methods)

**Files Created**:
- `include/sharp/Dialect/Txn/TxnDialect.td`
- `include/sharp/Dialect/Txn/TxnOps.td`
- Basic operation definitions

## 2025-07-02 - TXN Implementation Progress

### Morning: Core TXN Operations

**Work Completed**:
- Implemented `txn.module` operation
- Added `txn.action_method` and `txn.value_method` operations
- Created basic verification logic

**Technical Decisions**:
- Methods use function-like syntax with explicit return types

## 2025-07-03 - Conflict Matrix and Scheduling

### Morning Session (ID: session-20250703-001)

**User Request**: Add conflict matrix and scheduling support to TXN dialect

**Major Feature Added**: Conflict Matrix
- Added `txn.schedule` operation with conflict matrix attribute
- Matrix represents pairwise conflicts between methods:
  - 0 (SB): Sequence Before
  - 1 (SA): Sequence After  
  - 2 (C): Conflict
  - 3 (CF): Conflict Free

**Files Modified**:
- Updated TxnOps.td with schedule operation
- Added dictionary attribute for conflict matrix
- Implemented verification logic

### Afternoon: Analysis Infrastructure

**Work Completed**:
- Created analysis pass framework
- Added infer-conflict-matrix pass
- Started implementation of automatic conflict detection

## 2025-07-04 - Python Bindings Challenges

### Session: Python Integration Struggles

**Problem Encountered**: 
Python bindings were failing to import with undefined symbol errors

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. MLIR Python bindings use a complex initialization system
2. The `_mlir` module contains C++ implemented submodules
3. Package prefixes in CMake must match runtime structure
4. Sharp was trying to create independent bindings instead of extending CIRCT's

**Solution Implemented**:
- Changed approach to extend CIRCT bindings (like PyCDE does)
- Used proper package prefix configuration
- Simplified binding structure to reuse CIRCT infrastructure

**Key Learning**: 
Don't fight the MLIR Python binding system - work with it by extending existing bindings rather than creating parallel structures.

### Files Modified
- `lib/Bindings/Python/CMakeLists.txt` - Fixed package structure
- `lib/Bindings/Python/TxnModule.cpp` - Simplified to extend CIRCT bindings
- Created operations programmatically instead of importing

### Technical Details Documented
- How MLIR dialects expose Python bindings
- Why _mlir submodules cause import issues  
- How PyCDE successfully extends CIRCT bindings
- Package prefix mechanism and configuration

### Validation/Testing Issues
During testing of Python bindings:
- Initial approach of standalone PySharp package failed
- Discovered operations should be created programmatically
- Operations should be created using MLIR Python API instead

### Documentation Created
Created comprehensive `docs/python_binding.md` explaining:
- MLIR/CIRCT Python binding architecture
- Package prefix mechanism and why it matters
- How PyCDE avoids _mlir import issues
- Recommended solutions for binding structure

### Results
- Python bindings now work correctly with pixi Python 3.13
- PySharp can import and use Sharp functionality
- Build completes without errors
- Import structure follows established patterns

### Technical Insights
1. MLIR Python bindings are sensitive to package structure
2. The _mlir module uses C++ submodules that require proper initialization
3. Package prefixes must match between CMake configuration and runtime
4. PyCDE succeeds by reusing CIRCT bindings, not creating its own
5. Dialect operations in MLIR Python are typically created programmatically, not imported as modules

## 2025-07-05 - Documentation Update and Fixes

### User Request
The user identified several issues in the documentation:
1. `txn.read`/`txn.write` operations were used incorrectly - these are not implemented
2. `simulation.md` lacked methodology insights
3. Parametric primitive syntax in `txn_primitive.md` was wrong
4. `txn.launch` disappeared from `execution_model.md`

### Work Done

#### 1. Fixed txn.read/txn.write Usage
- Replaced all instances with proper `txn.call` to primitive methods across all docs
- Correct syntax: `%val = txn.call @instance.method() : () -> Type`
- Updated examples in simulation.md, txn.md, execution_model.md, and txn_primitive.md

#### 2. Enhanced simulation.md
Added comprehensive methodology sections:
- **Key Design Principles**: Event-driven architecture, 1RaaT semantics, multi-level abstraction
- **Technical details**: Event struct, DAM methodology explanation
- **Simulation Methodology**: Guidance on choosing simulation levels
- **Performance optimization strategies**: Event queue, concurrent tuning, memory management
- **Verification methodology**: Reference models, assertions, coverage

#### 3. Fixed Parametric Primitive Grammar
- Corrected syntax: `%inst = txn.instance @name of @Primitive<Type> : !txn.module<"Primitive">`
- Fixed all examples to use actual test file patterns
- Added realistic control flow and conflict matrices

#### 4. Restored txn.launch Documentation
- Added section showing both approaches:
  - Current: timing attributes (`attributes {timing = "static(3)"}`)
  - Future: `txn.launch {latency=3} { ... }` blocks
- Clarified implementation status

### Documentation Quality Improvements
- All MLIR examples now match actual test file syntax
- Added technical insights and rationale for design decisions
- Enhanced examples with more realistic use cases
- Clear distinction between implemented and planned features

### Key Learnings
- Documentation must stay synchronized with implementation
- Test files are the best source of truth for syntax
- Users value both practical examples and theoretical insights

## 2025-07-06 - Simulation Workspace Generation & Tutorial Creation

### Morning: Implementing Workspace Generation Feature
**Session ID**: Current session (continuing from 2025-07-05)

**User Request**: "Move forward STATUS.md" - Implement the **Simulation Workspace** feature specified in STATUS.md:
- Instead of generating only C++ code, generate complete workspaces containing:
  - C++ code
  - Build script (CMake) 
  - README (how to build and run the product)
- The generated workspace should not rely on LLVM, CIRCT, or MLIR (standalone)

**Implementation Progress**:
1. **Created SimulationWorkspaceGenerator class** in TxnSimulatePass.cpp:
   - Generates Counter_sim.cpp with simulation code
   - Creates CMakeLists.txt for building the simulation
   - Generates README.md with build/run instructions
   - Creates SimulationBase.h/cpp with base simulation infrastructure

2. **Fixed Compilation Issues**:
   - Resolved forward declaration problems by reordering CppCodeGenerator and SimulationWorkspaceGenerator classes
   - Fixed InstanceOp method names (getModule() → getModuleName(), getInstanceName() → getSymName())
   
3. **Fixed Code Generation Bug**:
   - Issue: Generated code was using `count.read_data` instead of `count_data`
   - Root cause: The call operation handler was checking for `.read` in leaf reference, but with `::` syntax it's just `read`
   - Solution: Updated both `generateSimpleActionMethod` and `generateSimpleValueMethod` to check for both `.read`/`.write` and plain `read`/`write`
   - Result: Code now correctly generates `count_data` for primitive state access

4. **Successful Workspace Generation**:
   - Created test script `test-workspace-gen.sh` to extract C++ code from simulation pass output
   - Generated complete counter workspace with all required files
   - Successfully built and ran the simulation executable
   - Simulation runs with configurable cycles, verbose output, and statistics

5. **Created Workspace Generation Tool**:
   - Developed `tools/generate-workspace.sh` script
   - Properly handles MLIR pass option syntax (`--sharp-simulate="mode=translation"`)
   - Extracts C++ code from pass output (before MLIR module dump)
   - Generates all required files for standalone simulation

   - Updated execution phases to match STATUS.md specification
   - Removed scheduling phase (schedule is pre-specified in MLIR)
   - Added Value Phase for calculating value method results
   - Updated multi-cycle execution semantics
   - Fixed method conflict documentation

2. **Fixed terminology throughout codebase** ✅
   - Updated txn.md documentation
   - Fixed schedule documentation to clarify only actions are scheduled

   - Validates schedules only contain actions (rules and action methods)
   - Emits errors if value methods appear in schedules
   - Created comprehensive test suite with 6 test cases
   - Added to build system and pass infrastructure

**Key Semantics Clarified**:
- No scheduling phase - schedule is already in MLIR file
- Value methods must be conflict-free with all actions
- Actions cannot call other actions in same module
- Value Phase calculates all value method results once per cycle
- Action method stalls until enabled by parent or all callers abort

**Next Steps**:
- Add pass to check value methods are conflict-free ✅
- Add pass to check actions don't call other actions in same module ✅
- Update txn-to-firrtl conversion for new execution model ✅
- Fix simulation code to match new semantics (in progress)

4. **Added Value Method Conflict Check Pass** ✅
   - Created `--sharp-check-value-method-conflicts` analysis pass
   - Validates value methods have only CF relationships
   - Detects SA/SB/C conflicts that violate execution model
   - Created test suite with 6 test cases

5. **Added Action Call Validation Pass** ✅
   - Created `--sharp-validate-action-calls` analysis pass
   - Prevents actions from calling other actions in same module
   - Allows actions to call value methods and child instance methods
   - Created test suite with 6 test cases

6. **Updated TxnToFIRRTL Conversion** ✅
   - Added validation to reject value methods in schedules
   - Added check to prevent action-to-action calls in same module
   - Added execution model documentation to ConversionContext
   - Tracks current Txn module for validation purposes

**Remaining Tasks**:
- Fix simulation code to implement Value Phase ✅
- Update Python bindings and frontends
- Update tests that violate new execution model
- Update remaining documentation and examples
- Consider removing timing attributes
- Implement launch operations

7. **Updated Simulation Code Generation** ✅
   - Modified TxnSimulatePass to generate three-phase execution model
   - Added value method caching in SimModule class
   - Implemented proper action scheduling based on schedule operation
   - Updated SimulationBase header to include:
     - Schedule tracking (action execution order)
     - Conflict matrix storage
     - Value method cache with lazy evaluation
   - Rewrote simulation loop to follow execution phases:
     - Phase 1: Value methods computed on-demand and cached
     - Phase 2: Actions executed in schedule order respecting conflicts
     - Phase 3: Value cache cleared for next cycle
   - Added generateInlineConflictMatrix for constructor initialization

**Progress Summary**:
- All high-priority tasks completed (execution model, validation passes, conversion updates)
- Core infrastructure now enforces the new execution model
- Simulation generates code following the three-phase semantics
- Ready to update remaining components (Python, tests, docs)

### Evening Session 1: Launch Operations Implementation

**User Request**: Fix namespace issue and proceed with conversion/simulation support for launch operations

**Task**: Implement launch operations for multi-cycle execution per STATUS.md

**Work Completed**:

1. **Removed Timing Attributes** ✅
   - Confirmed timing attributes (combinational/static/dynamic) were not used anywhere
   - Removed from ValueMethodOp, ActionMethodOp, and RuleOp in TxnOps.td
   - Updated all test files to remove timing attribute references
   - Cleaned up documentation

2. **Implemented Launch Operations** ✅
   - Added FutureOp to TxnOps.td: Encloses multi-cycle actions with launches
   - Added LaunchOp to TxnOps.td: Deferred execution with dependencies/latency
   - Syntax supports:
     - Static latency: `txn.launch after N { ... }`
     - Dynamic dependency: `txn.launch until %cond { ... }`
     - Combined: `txn.launch until %cond after N { ... }`
   - Implemented LaunchOp verifier:
     - Ensures body region is not empty
     - Requires txn.yield terminator
     - Must have either condition or latency

3. **Fixed Build Issues** ✅
   - Initial problem: TableGen-generated code had namespace resolution issues
   - Root cause: Generated operations were in `sharp::txn` namespace but couldn't find MLIR types
   - Solution:
     - Added BytecodeOpInterface include to TxnOps.h
     - Fixed all extraClassDeclaration blocks to use fully-qualified types (::mlir::)
     - Fixed OpBuilder declarations to use ::mlir:: namespace
     - Removed inner namespace approach that was causing confusion
   - Build now succeeds with all operations properly generated

4. **Added Conversion and Simulation Support** ✅
   - TxnToFIRRTL conversion:
     - Added handling for FutureOp and LaunchOp
     - Currently emits error: "not yet supported in FIRRTL conversion"
     - Created test file to verify error handling
   - Simulation support:
     - Added handling in TxnSimulatePass for both operations
     - Generates TODO comments for multi-cycle execution
     - LaunchOp generates completion signal (always 1 for now)
     - Fixed latency attribute access (using optional correctly)

5. **Testing** ✅
   - Created `test/Dialect/Txn/launch-simple.mlir` to verify parsing
   - Created `test/Dialect/Txn/launch-conversion-error.mlir` for FIRRTL error
   - All tests pass correctly
   - Launch operations parse and build successfully

**Technical Details**:
- FutureOp uses SingleBlock and NoTerminator traits
- LaunchOp returns an i1 "done" signal for completion tracking
- Assembly format supports clean syntax without extra braces
- Operations are documented in execution_model.md (already existed)

**Status**: Launch operations are fully implemented at the syntax/parsing level. Full synthesis support requires additional multi-cycle infrastructure in the conversion and simulation backends.

**Key Learning**: TableGen namespace issues can be tricky. The solution is to either include generated code outside namespaces (like CIRCT does) or use fully-qualified types in all TableGen definitions.

### Evening Session 2: Multi-Cycle Simulation Implementation

**User Request**: Implement and test the multi-cycle simulation infrastructure according to docs/execution_model.md

**Work Completed**:

1. **Multi-Cycle Execution Infrastructure** ✅
   - Added LaunchState struct to track launch execution state (Pending → Running → Completed)
   - Added MultiCycleExecution struct to track multi-cycle action state
   - Created MultiCycleSimModule class extending SimModule with multi-cycle support
   - Implemented updateMultiCycleExecutions method to process launches each cycle
   - Modified simulator loop to call updateMultiCycleExecutions for multi-cycle modules

2. **Code Generation Updates** ✅
   - Modified TxnSimulatePass to detect modules with multi-cycle actions
   - Generate MultiCycleSimModule base class for modules containing FutureOp
   - Added generateMultiCycleActionMethod for multi-cycle action code generation
   - Added generateMultiCycleRule for multi-cycle rule code generation
   - Generate per-cycle actions that execute immediately
   - Generate launch bodies with full operation support

3. **Launch Operation Support** ✅
   - Static latency tracking with targetCycle calculation
   - Dynamic dependency tracking via conditionName lookup
   - Launch body generation with arithmetic operations and primitive calls
   - Proper state machine for launch execution

4. **Bug Fixes** ✅
   - Fixed primitive state access bug (count.read_data → count_data)
   - Fixed symbol reference parsing for nested calls (@count::@read syntax)
   - Fixed build errors with proper namespace resolution
   - Fixed unused variable warnings

5. **Comprehensive Testing** ✅
   - Created multi-cycle-simulation.mlir with all launch types
   - Created multi-cycle-static-launch.mlir for static latency testing
   - Created multi-cycle-dynamic-launch.mlir for dependency testing
   - Created multi-cycle-rule.mlir for multi-cycle rule testing
   - Created multi-cycle-combined.mlir for combined launch testing
   - Created multi-cycle-firrtl-error.mlir to verify FIRRTL error handling
   - All tests pass and generate correct C++ code

**Technical Achievements**:
- Complete multi-cycle execution tracking with proper state management
- Launch dependency resolution using string-based naming
- Panic behavior for failed static launches
- Retry behavior for dynamic launches
- Per-cycle actions execute before any launches start
- Full operation support in launch bodies (arithmetic, primitive calls)

**Key Learning**: 
- MLIR nested symbol references use @module::@method syntax with two @ symbols
- Symbol reference parsing requires careful handling of root vs leaf references
- Multi-cycle infrastructure requires careful separation of immediate vs deferred execution
