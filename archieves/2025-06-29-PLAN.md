- Add conflict matrix (CM) in modules, including "sequence before" (SB), "sequence after" (SA), "conflict" (C), "conflict-free" (CF).
- Add timing attributes to rules/methods. It can be either combinational or multi-cycle: Combinational | Static(cycle: i32) | Dynamic
  - Both Static and Dynamic are considered as multi-cycle.
- Add passes to translate sharp.txn into firrtl (and finally into verilog/systemverilog)

  - Synthesizable primitives, placed under `lib/Dialect/Txn/primitives/`, should be translated into firrtl primitives, the corresponding firrtl primitives should be added to a directory (maybe `lib/Dialect/Txn/primitives/firrtl/`), every primitive correspond to a file which contains the firrtl module of the primitive. Currently, we need the `Register` and `Wire` primitive.
  - Nonsynthesizable primitives and multi-cycle rules/methods should be checked by an analysis. Currently, they are not allowed for the translation (throw out a failure message).
  - Algorithm:
    - The conflict matrix should be completed by an inference pass (this should be an analysis pass? since the submodule's conflict matrix will be queried by the parent module for inference). Note that, only actions (rules or action methods) are considered for the conflict matrix. Inference rules:
      - Any action conflict (C) with itself.
      - If two actions are both SA and SB, they are conflict (C).
      - If two actions call the same action method of a same instance, they are conflict (C).
      - If two actions (a0, a1) call two action methods (m0, m1)
        - m0 SA m1 => a0 SA a1
        - m0 SB m1 => a0 SB a1
        - m0 C m1 => a0 C a1
      - If actions cannot be determined to be SA, SB, C, or CF, they are conflict-free (CF).
    - The translation should be an extension of the Koika translation. Koika does not support methods, but we need to support them. In Koika, the will-fire (wf) logic is determined by `ok` (not reaching abort) and no conflicts between register read/write actions. In txn-to-firrtl, the wf logic should be extended to consider general conflicts between actions (specified by the conflict matrix). For example, the current action (either rule or method) writes to a register, and there has already been a previous action that writes to the same register, then the current action should not fire, which should be handled by the generated wf logic. Also, if a rule calls the same action method of an instance multiple times, the wf logic must return false since this is a conflict (C).
  - The translation should be done in a bottom-up manner. The submodule should be translated first, and then the parent module.
- Add options in sharp-opt to trigger the translation (with different export-verilog options https://circt.llvm.org/docs/VerilogGeneration/)
